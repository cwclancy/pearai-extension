## Get started

> Pre-requisite: you have installed [git][install-git], [node][install-node] and [pnpm][install-pnpm].

1. Clone the repo: `git clone git@github.com:trypear/pearai-extension.git`
1. Go into the cloned repository: `cd pearai-extension`
1. Clone the repo: `git clone git@github.com:trypear/pearai-extension.git`
1. Go into the cloned repository: `cd pearai-extension`
1. Install dependencies: `pnpm install`
1. Build the extension: `pnpm build-all`

The project uses [TypeScript][typescript], [Vitest][vitest] for the tests and [Prettier][prettier] for the formatting.

## Run the tests

You can run tests with `pnpm test`

To run them in watch mode, use: `pnpm test-watch`.

## Run it locally

The extension can be run in two ways:

Interally within the main PearAI application (which is a VSCode fork): https://github.com/trypear/pearai/

Externally as an extension: https://github.com/trypear/pearai-extension/

This guide is for running it externally. For running it internally, you will need to clone [pearai](https://github.com/trypear/pearai/) and visit [Contributing to pearai](https://github.com/trypear/pearai/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md)

You can use [VS Code's built-in debugger][vscode-debug-extension] on the project to try out your local extension.

To build the project, press `F5`. It should run the `run - app/vscode` task.

You can also use: `command+shift+P` -> `Debug: Select and Start Runnning` -> `run - app/vscode`.

This will:

1. Build the project
2. Open a new "Extension Development Host" VS Code window, with your local code overriding your "PearAI" extension

It's handy to test your changes in integration with VS Code API.

### Useful resources to start changing the code

- [VS Code Extension API documentation][vscode-extension-docs] is a good start
- [OpenAI API documentation][openai-docs] is also useful if you plan to change the prompts

### Code Style

Style formatting is managed by [Prettier][prettier]. It runs as a pre-commit hook, so you shouldn't have to worry about it.

## Open a PR and add acknowledge your contribution

You can open a Pull-Request at any time. It can even be a draft if you need to ask for guidance and help. Actually, we'd be pretty happy to assist you going in the best direction!

Once everything is ready, open a Pull-Request (if it's not already done) and ask for a review. We'll do our best to review it asap.

Finally, [use all-contributors bot command][all-contributors-bot-command] to add yourself to the list of contributors. It's very easy to do, you basically need to mention the bot in a comment of your PR.

Whether it's code, design, typo or documentation, every contribution is welcomed! Thank you!
